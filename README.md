# Blockchain Timestamping Smart Policy for [Trailbot](https://trailbot.io)
This [Trailbot Smart Policy][1] embeds the hash of your files into the blockchain every time they are modified.

Blockchain timestamping is made possible by sending the anonymous hashes to the [Stampery API][2]. They embed the hashes into the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains and then return a __cryptographic proof__ that you can securely store for further proving integrity, existence and ownership of your files and logs.

The cryptographic proofs generated by this smart policy are __independently verifiable__ by everyone in the world, so you get an __immutable audit trail__ of your file changes that will still be __valid__ even if Stampery or Trailbot disappeared.
